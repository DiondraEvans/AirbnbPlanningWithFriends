<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My app, which is the final project as a Per Scholas software engineering apprentice, is a React app that utilizes the MERN stack. Based off of the popular accommodation booking app Airbnb, my app incorporates a unique feature that allows friends to plan together. Using mongoose models and Express for the backend, my website offers a seamless and user-friendly experience for users to book accommodations and plan trips with their friends.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository. Then, use the "git clone" command followed by the repository's URL to create a local copy of the repository on your computer.</li>
<li>Install dependencies: If the repository you cloned has any dependencies, you need to install them before running the code. Navigate to the project directory and run "npm install" </li>
<li>Set up environment variables: If the project requires any environment variables to run, you need to set them up. Create a file named ".env" in the root directory of the project and add the required variables with their values.</li>
<li>Run the server: Navigate to the project directory and run the command to start the server. The command can vary "node server.js" (doing this make sure you run "npm run build" if you made an edit before "node server.js") or "npm run dev" to see edits as you make them</li>
<li>Access the project in the browser: Once the server is running, you can access the project in your browser by entering the URL "localhost:port" where "port" is the port number that the server is listening on. The port number is usually specified in the project's configuration file. if you do the command "npm run dev" it will automatically run the the project in the browser.</li>
